# Multi string input

A simple component to handle multi string input, and save them as an array. (written in Angular)

It renders an `<textarea>`, and each line is one item in the array. It's good for long, multi string inputs like a list of URLs.

Usage:
```html
<multi-string-input [list]="myList"></multi-string-input>
```
